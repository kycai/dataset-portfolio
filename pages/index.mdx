# Carbon-neutral/-negative Construction Materials

An open-source platform for Carbon-neutral/-negative Construction Material Datasets.

The urgency to decarbonize cement and concrete production is imperative in the face of escalating global climate change, considering their significant production is responsible for approximately 9% of global CO2 emissions. 

Advancements in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising avenues for the development of carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative construction materials. These sophisticated technologies can rapidly analyze complex material compositions, optimize production processes, and predict performance attributes, leading to more sustainable alternatives. 

To harness the full potential of ML, there is a pressing need to establish comprehensive datasets. Equally crucial is the promotion of open-source platforms where researchers worldwide can collaboratively access, modify, and improve upon these datasets. Such collaborative efforts will not only expedite the discovery of sustainable cementitious materials but also democratize the innovations, making them accessible to all.
