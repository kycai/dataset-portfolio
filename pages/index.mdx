# Construction Material Datasets

A collection of construction material datasets for cement and concrete decarbonization.

The urgency to decarbonize cement and concrete production is imperative in the face of escalating global **climate change**, considering their production is responsible for approximately 9% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 

Advancements in **artificial intelligence** (AI) and **machine learning** (ML) offer promising avenues for the development of carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative construction materials. These technologies can rapidly analyze complex material compositions, optimize production processes, and predict performance attributes, leading to more sustainable alternatives. 

To harness the full potential of AI/ML methods, there is a pressing need to establish comprehensive **datasets**. Equally crucial is the promotion of **open-source** platforms where researchers worldwide can collaboratively access, modify, and improve upon these datasets. Such collaborative efforts will not only expedite the discovery of sustainable cementitious materials but also democratize the innovations.
