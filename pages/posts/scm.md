# SCM dataset


Utilizing **Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs)** as partial substitutes for cement presents a viable approach to concrete decarbonization. Given the vast sources of SCMs and their varied compositions, designing cementitious mixtures that incorporate SCMs and achieve desired performance (e.g., adequate strength) becomes complicated.

A comprehensive dataset, encompassing both SCMs and SCM-integrated cementitious materials, has been collected. The dataset features include particle size, chemical compositions, mineralogical components, and standardized test parameters alongside the associated specimen formulations. Within this dataset, various indices serve as labels, including reactivity heat, and compressive strength.
